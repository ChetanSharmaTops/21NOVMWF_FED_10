    <p>An HTML &lt;entity&gt; is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon
        (;). Entities are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML
        code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces). You can also use them in place of other characters
        that are difficult to type with a standard keyboard.</p>
